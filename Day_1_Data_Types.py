#The variables i,d ,s and are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

#Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
#Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your 3 variables.
#Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
#Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
#Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
#Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.

#Solution:

i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank'

a=int(input())
b=float(input())
c=input()

print(i+a)
print(d+b)
print(s+c)
